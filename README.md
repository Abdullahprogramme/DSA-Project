# Data Structures and Algorithms project

### Team members:
1. Abdullah Tariq
2. Faheem Haider
3. Shiekh M. Muneeb

### Implementation
We are making a quad tree which recursively breaks a image into four quadrants based in the colour ratio inside the quadrant. Once the Quad tree is made, the recursive search for all the values inside the tree is done starting from the root quadrant each time and then (left_top - right_top - left_bottom - right_bottom) quadrants in this order. It takes a '.jpg' format image and makes a new compressed image on the path given.

### Libraries used:
1. numpy
2. Image from PIL
3. ImageDraw from PIL

### To clone repositry use the provided command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdullahprogramme/DSA-Project
```
### Change the path to the image attached or attach any other image if you want and adjust accordingly.
