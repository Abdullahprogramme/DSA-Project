# Data Structures and Algorithms project

### Team members:
1. Abdullah Tariq
2. Faheem Haider
3. Shiekh M. Muneeb

### Implementation
We are making a quad tree which recursively breaks a image into four quadrants based in the colour ratio inside the quadrant. It takes a '.jpg' format image and makes a new compressed image on the path given.

### Libraries used:
1. numpy
2. Image from PIL
3. ImageDraw from PIL
